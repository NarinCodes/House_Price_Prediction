# House_Price_Prediction
The Bangalore housing dataset from Kaggle is used to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house. The user only needs to specify the no. of bedrooms and bathrooms, total square ft. of area, and the location of the house for which a predicted price is needed. Several steps of data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal are done using the Python pandas library. Data visualizations are done using the Matplotlib package, and the final model is selected based on Cross Validation and Grid Search results from Scikit-Learn. Accuracy scores from Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree models were compared before choosing the most robust model for making predictions (final accuracy of 81%).
